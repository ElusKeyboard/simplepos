Simple POS
--------------

Simple POS is an effort to create a simple and usable Point of Sales system.
I was looking for an Open source point of sale system and was frustrated that not a single decent open source point of sale system exists for small merchants.

This project doesn't intend to replace commercial big software for big chain stores. This is meant for small shop owners selling goods who just want to track inventory, get simple reports and print receipts.
Project also aims to be very easy to setup so it's written in Go and uses SQLite as backend.

This is a work in progress, and might not be completed anytime soon. README will be updated with installation instructions when we're ready.
